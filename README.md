# Suicide Rates 

Suicide is one of the major leading causes of deaths. Close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds and there are many more people who attempt suicide. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the second leading cause of death. Effective and Evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. The goal of my project is to analyze the significant suicide rates trends patterns happening globally and leading cause/methods of suicides. The motivation of this project is a series of suicides happening all around the world without no reason because of depression. The result of this analysis helps the government bodies in understanding on how to bring new laws to reduce the suicide rates and furtherly to enhance already existed laws used in preventing suicide rates.
